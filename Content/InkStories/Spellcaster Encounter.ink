    This realm between realms exists due to the residual energy of what you islanders refer to as "The Great Whale". We are currently inside the physical manifestasion of that creature's spirit.

    I don't expect you to understand. While your people know the Great Whale is powerful, your knowledge of the spiritual and arcane is... primitive at best.

    -> dead

    No, it's dead. But a being of power this immense leaves something behind even after death. It seems your people understood that the energy of this creature has been "watching over" the island in a sense.
    
    + [Then what are you doing here?]
    -> savingthewhale

    -> religion

    = religion
    Well, it's your religion, not mine. I'm sure the islanders believe it has something to do with protection from bad weather, blessings of bountiful food, that sort of thing. A spiritual presence this immense would certainly scare off any malicious spirits, so perhaps it's true that it protects the island in a way.

    Me? Kill the Great Whale? There's no way I could accomplish something like that, nor would I want to. No, this majestic creature died a long, long time ago. Its spirit has been residing here since, which is why I'm confused as to what has suddenly changed.

    I am attempting to save The Great Whale's spirit. Something is causing it to leave this plane of existence, though I am not quite sure what it is or how to stop it.

    = spells
    I've cast a variety of spells, mostly to measure the energy of The Whale and help determine what exactly is going on. However, the spell you see before you [pretend there are visual effects] is designed to rewind time.

    -> tsunamicause
    
    
    
    
    
    = tsunamicause
    As The Whale's spirit prepares to leave this realm, its power swells. Like the dying of a star, the very end of its life cycle will culminate in a massive explosion of energy.

    -> tsunamicause2
    + [what will that energy do?]

    Yes, in our physical world, such a massive surge of spiritual energy might manifest in such a form. If I end my spell, calamity will still be unleashed upon the island.

    Understand that what you are proposing is a risk. Could you drink the ocean with a thimble, even if you had an eternity? There's no guarantee that we will ever contain the Great Whale, even with all the time in the world. 
    
    + [Do you want the loop to continue or not?]
    -> risk
    + [We have to try.]
    -> understanding
    + [Then what are you still doing here?]
    -> musttry




    = musttry
    I've been aware of the risks from the start. Still I must do what I can to contain the spirit of the whale. I can't simply give up without even trying.
    
    + [You have already been trying for centuries.]
    -> perhaps
    + [When does it end? When do we decide when it's time to give up?]
    -> up2u
    
    
    
    = up2u
    I suppose that's up to you for the time being. You may at any point in the future change your mind and come back to end the loop if you so choose. Though I must warn you that if I am still "Unawoken" then you will encounter similar resistance as you have today.
    
    + [What about if you Awaken?]
    -> strength
    + [Okay.]
    -> understanding
    
    
    = strength
    Then it comes down to the strength of my spirit and how long I can continue on trying to find a solution. I could still very well never figure it out, it may be impossible. It could also be the case that it will only take a couple weeks once I am Awoken.
    
    + [Okay, I understand]
    -> understanding
    + [I've changed my mind]
    -> start
    
    
    
    
    
    = perhaps
    Perhaps what you say is true. But if you yourself have recently Awoken, isn't it possible that I could Awaken some time in the future? I have used the spell in the past, I can only assume I was unknowingly stuck in a loop until my Awawkening on those previous occasions. So please, allow me to at least try.
    
    + [Okay.]
    -> understanding
    + [I've changed my mind.]
    -> start
    
    
    
    
    = risk
    I wish to continue with my spell. I'm only asking because this is a risk I have been aware of from the beginning. If you accept this risk and still wish to try then we are in agreement. If not...
    
    + [I accept the risk.]
    -> understanding
    + [I've changed my mind.]
    -> start
    
    
    
    = understanding
    Then we've reached an understanding. The loop will continue indefinitly, until we can find a way out where everyone lives. I trust that until that time, you will do what you can to ensure the loop is peaceful. [THIS IS ONE ENDING]
    
    + [cool]
